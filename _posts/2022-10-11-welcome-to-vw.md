**Dear Neural Net Ninjas, Data Demons and Image Wizards!**

### Welcome to VisionWaves!

a blog dedicated to data science and image processing! I am thrilled to have you here and share my passion for computer vision, image and video processing, deep learning, and data science.

In this blog, I will be sharing my thoughts, insights, and experiences in these exciting fields. From exploring the latest advancements to sharing my projects on Kaggle, I hope to create a space where we can learn and grow together.

On the home tab, you'll find the latest posts and feed, keeping you up to date with my latest thoughts and discoveries. The projects tab will give you an insight into the bigger projects I have worked on, and the categories tab is where you'll find the posts grouped by topic in a table of contents. Lastly, the publications tab will feature my academic publications and scientific documents.

I hope you find my blog informative and insightful. Please feel free to reach out to me with any comments, questions or suggestions. I look forward to hearing from you and wish you happy reading!
